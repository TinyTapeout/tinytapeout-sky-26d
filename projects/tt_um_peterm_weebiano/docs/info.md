## How it works

8 input "piano", each button represents a note, 8 outputs go to VGA to display currently playing note and a small looping animation or a short 2 frame "idle" animation. An additional IO pin is reserved to connect a passive buzzer to playback the corresponding note that gets presssed.

## How to test

Connect all external hardware and power up, start playing notes by pushing the buttons, watch animations change between idle and 'singing'animation.

## External hardware

8 pushbuttons to inputs, vga output and a passive buzzer to uio0 to playback sound.
